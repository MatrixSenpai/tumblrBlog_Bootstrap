        <b>What's alexithymia?</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s (very basically) the inability to feel emotions. More information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia">here</a>

      <li>
        <b>Are you really asexual?</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s a bit more complicated. Due to my alexithymic nature, I have a very low sex drive. Basically, I don’t care for nor see the need for gender. If asked, I may say yes to either gender though

        <b>Why do you hate pop/rap/hip-hop?</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Glad you asked. Here are my top x reasons
        <ol>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Content</li>
              <li>
                These styles are mostly the same thing, over and over and over. Money, sex, drugs, cars, girls, boys, etc, etc. I want to hear something else, please!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Creativity</li>
              <li>
                Say what you want, these styles are by no means creative. They are just annoying, and need to go. Scientifically, pop music is generally the same 4 chords, which is why most of it sounds the same.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Theft</li>
              <li>
                The bands that produce this kind of music are stealing from the bands that actually produce good music. They make millions off worthless trash, taking the money and positions on the top charts from bands that are actually making good music.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Ideology</li>
              <li>
                The music that comes out of these genres supports worthless causes, ideologies, and thought processes. Sexualization, raving against people (pointlessly), etc.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Creativity</li>
              <li>
                What more can I say? There's literally no point to any of it.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Relativity</li>
              <li>
                While this may be the last point, it is the most important: I cannot in any way relate to any of this music. It doesn't make any sense to me. I don't understand it at any level
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Please note, this applies to 99.99% of the music in these genres. There is a (very!) small portion of this music I can enjoy. And there are some exceptions to this rule. This is just my general opinion
